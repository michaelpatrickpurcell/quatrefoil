## Overview
Quatrefoil is a cooperative puzzle game for four players that can be played in 5-10 minutes. It is suitable for all ages, but is intended for players who are eight years old or older.

During the game, you will work together to solve a puzzle. Communication is limited, however, so you you will need to be creative and attentive to effectively coordinate your efforts.

You can end the game whenever you think that you have solved the puzzle. If you are right, then everyone wins.  If not, then everyone loses.

## Components
  - __Tokens__ (5) -  one circular token in five colours: blue, green, purple, red, yellow.

  - __Position Cards__ (4) - one for each of the ordinal directions: northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast.

## Set Up
  1. Arrange four of the tokens in a square in the play area. This is the _quatrefoil_. The fifth token is the _free token_ and should be placed nearby.

  2. Deal one colour card and one position card face down to each player. Players may look at their own cards, but not those dealt to other players.

  3. Place the remaining colour card face down in the play area to one side of the quatrefoil. This card indicates which direction is _north_.

## Player turns
On your turn you must take one _actions_:
  - __Push__ - Place the free token next to any row or column of the quatrefoil. Slide that entire row or column by pushing on the free token until it is part of the quatrefoil.

  Notice that this will also eject a token from the quatrefoil. The ejected token becomes the free token for the next player's turn.

  - __Twist__ - Rotate the quatrefoil by ninety degrees in either direction (clockwise or anticlockwise).

## Turn Order
Play procceeds to the left (clockwise). That is, after you finish your turn the player to your left will go next.

## Correct Positions
The colour cards and the position cards together specify the correct position for each token.

The correct positions of four of the tokens are specified by the cards held by the players. These tokens should be in the quatrefoil. Your position card specifies the correct position in the quatrefoil for the token specified by your colour card.

The remaining token should should be the free token. Because it should not be in the quatrefoil, it does not have an associated position card.

## Communication
During the game, communication between players is strictly limited. At any time, you may only indicate whether your token is in the correct position or not.

This should be done using a simple nonverbal signal. Many players like to give a "thumbs up" gesture when their token is in the correct position.

## Winning the Game
The game ends when anyone takes the stack action.

Everyone wins if all of the tokens are in their correct positions when the game ends. If any token is not in its correct position, then everyone loses.

## Variants

__Nothing to Hide__ - Turn all of the colour cards and position cards face up. Try to solve the puzzle in as few moves as possible. This is a good variant to try when you are first learning how to play.

__Half and Half__ - Pick either colour cards or position cards. Turn all of those cards face up. Keep the other cards face down. Try to solve the puzzle in as few moves as possible. This is a good variant to try when playing with all cards face up gets too easy.

__Race the Clock__ - As in the base game, deal all of the colour cards and position cards face down. After you look at your cards, start a two-minute timer. Try to solve the puzzle before time expires. This is a good variant to try when you have mastered the basic game and want a tougher challenge.

## Quatrefoil Dual
Another way to play is to reveal the solution to the puzzle up front, but limit what actions each player can take.

To play this way, set up the tokens in the middle of the play area, deal one position card to each player, and place one colour card near the quatrefoil as normal.

Then, deal the remaining colour cards face up in a square near the quatrefoil. These four cards specify the correct position for each token.

During the game, anyone can take an action at any time. You may take the twist or stack actions as normal. You may only take a push actino that concludes with the free token in the position indicated on your position card.

You may only communicate via your actions.

The game ends when anyone takes the stack action. Everyone wins if all fo the tokens are in their correct positions. Otherwise, everyone loses.

For an additional challenge, start a two-minute timer immediately after dealing the last card. Try to solve the puzzle before time expires.

## Fun Facts
The word [quatrefoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrefoil) means "four leaves", from the Latin _quattuor_, "four", plus _folium_, "leaf". The term refers specifically to a four-leafed clover, but applies in general to four-lobed shapes in various contexts.
