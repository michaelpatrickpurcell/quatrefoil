## Fun Facts
As per its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrefoil), a quatrefoil is a decorative element consisting of a symmetrical shape which forms the overall outline of four partially overlapping circles of the same diameter. The word 'quatrefoil' means "four leaves", from the Latin _quattuor_, "four", plus _folium_, "leaf"; the term refers specifically to a four-leafed clover, but applies in general to four-lobed shapes in various contexts.
